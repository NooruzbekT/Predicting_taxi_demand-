#  Taxi Data Analysis

## 🚕 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing New York City taxi trip data using the dataset `original_cleaned_nyc_taxi_data_2018.csv` from Kaggle. The dataset can be found at [NYC Taxi Trip Data - Google Public Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neilclack/nyc-taxi-trip-data-google-public-data). The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`) and may include preprocessing, exploration, and preparation for modeling.

## 📦 Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.12+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (if visualization is added)
- Scikit-learn (if modeling is added)

You can install the requirements via pip:

```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## 📝 Steps in the Notebook

### 1. Loading Data
- Reads `original_cleaned_nyc_taxi_data_2018.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Displays the first few rows and checks the shape and basic statistics.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handles missing values.
- May filter irrelevant rows (e.g., trips with zero distance or amount).

### 3. Data Exploration
- Summarizes numerical columns.
- Visualizes distributions (if applicable).
- Looks at patterns: trip duration, distance, fare amount, etc.

### 4. Feature Engineering (if added)
- May include creation of new columns (e.g., average speed, time of day).
- Optional encoding of categorical data.

### 5. Model Training (optional)
- If implemented, splits the data into training/testing.
- Trains regression or classification models (e.g., fare prediction).

### 6. Evaluation
- Outputs performance metrics such as R² or accuracy.

## 🚀 Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/nyc-taxi-analysis
```

Launch the notebook:

```bash
  jupyter notebook "main.ipynb"
```

Make sure the dataset is located in the correct path, or modify the notebook to reflect the actual file location.

## 📌 Notes

- The dataset `original_cleaned_nyc_taxi_data_2018.csv` must be available (locally or via cloud path).
- You can extend this analysis with:
  - Geospatial mapping (pickup/dropoff coordinates)
  - Time-series trend analysis
  - Fare prediction models
- Supports integration with BigQuery, AWS S3, or Spark for large-scale processing.
